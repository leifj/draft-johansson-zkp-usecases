                  Use cases for Zero Knowledge Proofs
                  draft-johansson-zkp-usecases-latest

Abstract

   Zero Knowledge Proof technology relies on mathematical constructs
   that enable a sender to proove to a receiver that a piece of
   information has a certain agreed property without revealing that
   information or its source to the sender.  An example commonly given
   is the problem of prooving that a subject is older than a certain age
   without revealing the exact age or any other information to a
   receiver.  This document attempts to catalogue real world usecases
   for such technology.

1.  Introduction

   There are several ways to define the concept of zero knowledge
   proofs.  In this document we will rely on the SPICE architecture
   document to provide us with the basic terminology and use the
   following definition: A zero knowledge proof (zkp) is a mechanism by
   which the holder can proove to the verifier that a statement (S) is
   true without providing the verifier with any additional information
   other than the truthfullness of S.  A zkp mechanism is usually
   required to satisfy three properties:

   *  completeness: if S is true then a compliant implementation of the
      mechanism will accept the proof presented by a another compliant
      implementation.

   *  soundness: a non-compliant holder can't make a compliant
      implementation accept that S is true when it is in fact false.

   *  zero knowledge: if S is true then a verifier is not able to derive
      any other information than the fact that S is true from the
      mechanism.

   Zero knowledge mechanisms fulfil many privacy requirements for
   instance:

   *  holder-verifier unlinkability

   *  issuer-verifier unlinkability (aka collusion-resistant
      unlinkability)

   These properites come at a cost and zero knowledge proofs are both
   different from conventional cryptography aswell as often hard to
   implement and understand.  Additionally, the fact that zkp ensures
   unlinkability means that some use-cases that depend on linkability
   may not translate into architectures that rely on zkp.  This means
   that even if zkp is deployed, the information present in the proofs
   (ie the statement S) may in some cases be enough to fully identify
   the data subject in which case the deployment of zkp serves little
   purpouse.

   This document aims to describe some real-world usecases where the
   deployment of zkp makes sens from a business and technical
   perspective.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We also rely on the terminilogy from the SPICE architecture document.

3.  Why deploy zkp?

   Zero Knownledge Proof mechanisms are fundamentally about proving
   claims about data subjects with no (zero) auxilliary information
   leakage.  However zkp isn't the only method for addressing
   information leakage in the 3 party architecture.  Using [RFC9901],
   aka selective disclosure json web tokens (SD-JWT) it is possible to
   achive many but not all common privacy requirements.  Specifically it
   is not possible to prevent information leakage that results from the
   issuer and verfier colluding.

   In situations where collusion resistance is needed and SD-JWTs (and
   similar solutions) don't work zkp becomes a clear alternative.
   However even in situations where collusion resistance isn't
   necessary, zkp is sometimes a convenient alternative to other
   selective disclosure solutions for operational reasons.  For
   instance, a common way to deploy SD-JWTs is to use so called batch
   issuance.  In order to achive verifier-verifier unlinkability, the
   issuer provides the holder with a set of identical copies (a batch)
   of a given SD-JWT each signed with a unique key.  Whenever the holder
   generates a presentation to the verifier one of the SD-JWTs is
   "consumed", making them effectively one-time-use.

   There are situations where the salted hash approach used in SD-JWTs
   and mDOCs provides adequate privacy protection.  However, in order to
   achive verifier-verifier unlinkability the issuer creates N copies
   and N signatures each time a SD-JWT is issued and since this has to
   be repeated every time the batch "runs dry" at the holder, the issuer
   has to perform a large and recurring number of signatures.  Depending
   on how the infrastructure is setup, it may simply be cheaper from an
   operational point of view to use a zkp mechanism where a single
   credential can be issued and re-used by the holder for as long as it
   is valid.

   In some jurisdictions, legal requirements are beeing established to
   ensure enhanced privacy protection for use of online services.  Some
   legal regimes set down requirements that imply that only the minimal
   set of information required for each transaction must be transmitted.
   In such sitations it may be useful (but certainly not always
   required) to consider deploying zero knowledge proof technology.
   Some legal requirements take this further and outright require zero
   knowledge proof technology.  One such example is the [eIDAS]
   regulation.  However even in the case of eIDAS, the development of
   zkp schemes has effectively led to a "soft" requirement until
   development and standaridization efforts have caught up with legal
   requirements.

4.  Use cases

4.1.  Proof of age

   Proof of age means the ability to proove that a subject is above or
   below a required age.  Commonly cited use case include access to
   mature or age-limited content (eg related to online gambling).  Proof
   of age is also relevant when the subject needs to proove that he or
   she is below a certain age-limit, for instance when the subject is
   accessing an online service intended for, and meant to be a safe
   space for, children.

   A proof of age can be produced using a so called range-proof from a
   credential that contains an authentic date of birth or an authentic
   age claim for the subject.

4.2.  Proof of human

   Proof of human means the ability to proove that a subject is human.
   This could be achived by producing a zkp proof from a credential only
   given to humans.  It is often presumed that a passport or similar
   travel document, or the Personal Identity Document (PID) credentials
   envisioned by the eIDAS regulation will only be provided to humans
   but it is by no means certain that all countries and organizations
   that issue recognized ICAO travel documents would only issue them to
   persons (humans).  ICAO guidelines make no explicit requirement that
   only humans are allowed to obtain a passport or an emergency travel
   document but the term "person" indicates that this is the intent.

   The reason proof of human may be interesting follows from the
   increased use of semi-autonomous agents that sometimes acts
   independently from, or on loosely formulated instructions (prompts)
   from a human.  It may be useful to distinguish actions taken by a
   human from actions taken by an agent as the result of a prompt and
   also from actions taken independently from any human interaction.
   Such actions are sometimes, but not always recorded together with
   identifiable information and the use of zkp allows the trust in the
   "human:ness" to be seperated from any trust in the agent holding the
   authorzation for the act itself.

4.3.  Proof of liveness

   In the 3 party model a credential is issued to a digital "wallet"
   under the control of the subject.  Cryptographic controls - aka
   holder binding - is used to ensure that a given credential is issued
   to one specific wallet.  Cryptographic binding cannot however ensure
   that the subject is the only one able to control the wallet and it is
   sometimes necessary to know that a particular subject is in direct
   control of the wallet device.  This is sometimes called liveness
   checks and is commonly used when issuing credentials based on travel
   documents, drivers licenses and other documents that carry some form
   of biometric data that can be matched with a subject.  Liveness
   checks are carried out in order to ensure (to some degree) that the
   subject is physically present instead of (say) having their actions
   emulated by software.

   A liveness credential is a representation of a recent liveness check
   and the use of zkp enables a verifier to have confidence in that a
   trusted liveness verification has been done without providing any
   additional information.  It would be possible to combine the liveness
   check with an identity verification in the holder to be able to
   proove that the same individual holding an particular form of
   identity document (say a PID) was recently present and in control of
   the holder device.

4.4.  Proof of membership

   Many relationships can be represented as membership in a group; a
   subject is a student if they are a member of the group of students
   (at a particular institution), a subject is Danish if they are member
   of the group of Danish citizens etc.  The tautology aside, proof of
   membership is a very common requirement for things like discount
   systems, elligibility for certain business transactions etc.
   Examples include discounts to senior citizens, proof of a valid
   drivers license before renting a trailer etc.  Many of these cases do
   not require any proof of identity other than the proof of membership
   and whatever the economic transaction requires.

5.  Security Considerations
