                  Use cases for Zero Knowledge Proofs
                  draft-johansson-zkp-usecases-latest

Abstract

   Zero Knowledge Proof technology relies on mathematical constructs
   that enable a sender to proove to a receiver that a piece of
   information has a certain agreed property without revealing that
   information or its source to the sender.  An example commonly given
   is the problem of prooving that a subject is older than a certain age
   without revealing the exact age or any other information to a
   receiver.  This document attempts to catalogue real world usecases
   for such technology.

1.  Introduction

   There are several ways to define the concept of zero knowledge
   proofs.  In this document we will rely on the SPICE architecture
   document to provide us with the basic terminology and use the
   following definition: A zero knowledge proof (zkp) is a mechanism by
   which the holder can proove to the verifier that a statement (S) is
   true without providing the verifier with any additional information
   other than the truthfullness of S.  A zkp mechanism is usually
   required to satisfy three properties:

   *  completeness: if S is true then a compliant implementation of the
      mechanism will accept the proof presented by a another compliant
      implementation.

   *  soundness: a non-compliant holder can't make a compliant
      implementation accept that S is true when it is in fact false.

   *  zero knowledge: if S is true then a verifier is not able to derive
      any other information than the fact that S is true from the
      mechanism.

   Zero knowledge mechanisms fulfil many privacy requirements for
   instance:

   *  holder-verifier unlinkability

   *  issuer-verifier unlinkability (aka collusion-resistant
      unlinkability)

   These properites come at a cost and zero knowledge proofs are both
   different from conventional cryptography aswell as often hard to
   implement and understand.  Additionally, the fact that zkp ensures
   unlinkability means that some use-cases that depend on linkability
   may not translate into architectures that rely on zkp.  This means
   that even if zkp is deployed, the information present in the proofs
   (ie the statement S) may in some cases be enough to fully identify
   the data subject in which case the deployment of zkp serves little
   purpouse.

   This document aims to describe some real-world usecases where the
   deployment of zkp makes sens from a business and technical
   perspective.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We also rely on the terminilogy from the SPICE architecture document.

3.  Why deploy zkp?

   Zero Knownledge Proof mechanisms are fundamentally about proving
   claims about data subjects with no (zero) auxilliary information
   leakage.  However zkp isn't the only method for addressing
   information leakage in the 3 party architecture.  Using [RFC9901],
   aka selective disclosure json web tokens (SD-JWT) it is possible to
   achive many but not all common privacy requirements.  Specifically it
   is not possible to prevent information leakage that results from the
   issuer and verfier colluding.

   In situations where collusion resistance is needed and SD-JWTs (and
   similar solutions) don't work zkp becomes a clear alternative.
   However even in situations where collusion resistance isn't
   necessary, zkp is sometimes a convenient alternative to other
   selective disclosure solutions for operational reasons.  For
   instance, a common way to deploy SD-JWTs is to use so called batch
   issuance.  In order to achive holder-verifier unlinkability, the
   issuer provides the holder with a set of identical copies (a batch)
   of a given SD-JWT each signed with a unique key.  Whenever the holder
   generates a presentation to the verifier one of the SD-JWTs is
   "consumed", making them effectively one-time-use.

   There are many situations where this provides adequate privacy
   protection.  However, since the issuer creates N copies and N
   signatures each time a SD-JWT is issued and since this has to be
   repeated every time the batch "runs dry" at the holder, the issuer
   has to perform a large and recurring number of signatures.  Depending
   on how the infrastructure is setup, it may simply be cheaper from an
   operational point of view to use a zkp mechanism where a single
   credential can be issued and re-used by the holder for as long as it
   is valid.
